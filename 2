## Abstract
   This homework mainly talks about some basic operations with vim for those new to python under Linux system. In this document, I have listed fundamental knowledge about vim to get one quickly into using vim.
   
## Introduction
  For physics major students, computational physics has become a very important branch, especially when we have to deal with vast data. In various computing softwares, we turn to python, which is quite popular among modern physics field. In this document, I would present a general concept of the major editor we use -- vim. Then, I would show some basic tricks for writing a python program. 

## Body 
  In order to learn to use something new, we must know what it is and what it can do first. To put it in simple terms, vim is a kind of a editor, which you can use to write original program, just like writing simple text document. But this time, the readers are compilers and computers, so you have to use particular 'language' to make sure that the computer can understand what you want 'him' to do for you. Besides, you have to know that different 'languages' have its own unique 'grammars' and 'word'. Usually, they differ from each other, which is also quite common in real life: people from different places speak something with different languages. Consequently, you have to figure out what kind of machine your program are running on. 
   There are three kinds of modes for vim: the ***Normal*** mode, the ***Insert*** mode and last the ***Visual*** mode. When you start vim, you are under normal or command mode. Under this mode,  you can switch to any other two modes by press ' ***i*** ' or ' ***Insert*** ' button to enter ***Insert*** mode or press the colon key  ' ***:*** ' to get into the ***Visual*** mode. If you are in ***Insert*** mode, and you want to get into to ***Command*** mode. Press ***Esc***, and you will get to where you want. Or if you have write a program, and you want to store the file and quit. Press ***Esc*** to get into the ***Command*** mode, and then press ' ***:q*** ' to quit or press ' ***:wq*** ' to store the program and quit. With these tricks, you're able to survive in using vim. At last, I would show you how to write your first program.
First, input '**mkdir filename.py**' or '**touch filename.py**' to create a new file where you can store your program. Then input '**vim filename.py**' to enter the interface. After this step, you have got into the file you had just made. Next, press button ' ***i*** ' and write ' ***print "Hello, Vim!"*** . At last, input ' ***:wq*** ' to store your program and quit. Till now you have wrote your first program and store it in the file you had made. If you have install python, you can run the program in your computer by pressing ' ***python filename.py*** ' in your Linux  command interface. If you get  ***Hello, Vim!***, that means you have wrote your first program successfully.
